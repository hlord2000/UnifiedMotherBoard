# The Unified Mother Board project aims to create a standard for small form-factor keyboard microcontrollers.
## Goals:
- Simplify process for keyboard designers by offloading MCU design to UMB
- Provide a smaller form factor than other external microcontroller options (i.e. ProMicro)
- Allow the same keyboard "shield" to support many different microcontrollers depending on firmware or power requirements
- Reduction of e-waste by providing a verified MCU base
